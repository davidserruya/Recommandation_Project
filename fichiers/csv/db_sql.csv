After completing and releasing their film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, they were debating on what their next project would be. As they had a distrust for organised religion. Looking at Jesus as not a comical feature and what Jesus is known for and spoke was not exactly comedy material but what about mistaken identity. This would springboard The Life of Brian. The film would be filmed in Tunsia and use most of the sets from the miniseries of Zefferelli's Jesus of Nazereth even using most the crowd extras. The film would court controversy and be banned in numerous countries. Monty Python would use this in their advertising campaign to full effect. Saved. (2004) - Directed by Brian Dannelly and written by Dannelly and Michael Urban, this film is a teen comedy touching on religion, ostracism, homophobia, teen pregnancy, divorce and disability.

At the time, the film's good reviews were from film critics whilst the Christian presses gave it negative reviews.
